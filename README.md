# TaskList-vanillaJS
A basic vanilla JS Task List using MaterializeCSS
This Task List application uses Font Awesome and MaterializeCSS so that it does not need a separate CSS file.
The dependency for jQuery is a requirement for MaterializeCSS.
This project is the first project from Brad Traversy's 'Modern JS' course available from Udemy.com: Section 4: DOM Projects.
I have added more comments to better explain, to my mind, what each component does in the app.js file.
If there are any questions, feel free to get in touch.

I comment this project to the house.
